## Hi!

I'm Pedro Cabral. I like computers, calculators, microprocessors, books, hacking, and programming from **High Level Assembly** to **Julia**, **Python**, and **Rust**. Check out my website at [cabral.mat.br](cabral.mat.br) for blog posts, code and art..!

Currently, I'm working on the (https://github.com/mathrs/mathrs)[mathrs] project as my main focus.
